    <p>Welcome to 2048 game (by Guillaume)</p> <br>


    <div id="history">
        2048 was created in March 2014 by an Italian web developer who was inspired by the game of three"s. The then 19-year old Gabrielle Cirulli created the game in just one weekend and never expected the game to sky-rocket the way it did. It received over 4 million views just after its release. That"s massive. Irulli, however, has made the game freely available and does not want to make money off it as it"s not his original idea.
